# Myriad Settings

Settings that I want to make available on whichever computer/workspace I may be using.

### Disclaimer

The main purpose of this repo is to store my personal zsh visual settings so I can access them from anywhere.
Please note that these are the author's personal preferences, but are available to anyone who so choses to use them.
